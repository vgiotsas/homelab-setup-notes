<p>I have a number of old PCs and laptops that were sitting around, so I decided to start a home lab as an opportunity to learn different technologies and maybe develop something useful at the end.<br>
One solution was to put a linux distro to every one of those computers but since I’m interested in learning new things, among which is inter-networking across different OSes I decided to go with the OS of each computer and then if I’m fed up I’ll switch to linux.</p>

<p>First, Is started with an old Windows 10 PC. I want to install Doocker and Kubernetes on it, so I first downloaded <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>.</p>
<p>My first attempt in installing Docker Desktop was unsuccessful because it requires a newer version of Windows 10:</p>

<p>All my attempts to update the Windows Build through the Windows Update feature were unsuccessful, even though I could see the update being available. Fortunately, I found <a href="https://onlinecomputertips.com/support-categories/windows/update-windows10-version-22h2/">this page</a> on how to update it using Windows 10 Update Assistant which can be downloaded from the Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">website</a>.</p>
